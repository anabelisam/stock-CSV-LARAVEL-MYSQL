## CSV-LARAVEL-MYSQL-PHPUNIT
This project reads a .csv to alter table in a db by some parameters in the document. I'm using only PHP-Laravel and MySQL database.

I have made the respective process of planning and tracking tasks using Trello and my traditional drawing on paper and pencil.

At the end, the visual result is a table with the list of products in the database that you can find in planning / stock.sql and the input to import the .csv file
